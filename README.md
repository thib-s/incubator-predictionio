# predictionio for scala 2.11

this is a modification of the official predictionio in order to compile with scala 2.11

## DISCLAIMER
this is an experimental modification, some feature may not work as expected.

## Installation

simply run the following command:
	# bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thib-s/incubator-predictionio/develop/install-predictionio_2.11.sh)"
this script may be VERY long, as it's not optimized at all, it need to download all sources of predictionio & spark, and to compile everything
